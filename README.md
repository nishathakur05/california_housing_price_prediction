# California House Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting housing prices in California using Python and machine learning techniques. The dataset includes features such as geographic location, population statistics, median income, and various housing characteristics.

The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization to identify important trends and relationships within the data. A regression model is trained to predict house prices based on these features, demonstrating how data-driven approaches can be applied to real-world prediction problems.
