# California House Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting housing prices in California using Python and machine learning techniques. The dataset includes features such as location, population, median income, and housing characteristics. Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization were performed to understand key patterns and relationships. A regression model was trained to predict house prices based on these features, helping to demonstrate how data-driven approaches can be used to solve real-world prediction problems.
